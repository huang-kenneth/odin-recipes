        Description
    </h3>
    <p>
        A sweet and savory roasted pork, char siu is probably the most popular roasted meat preparation in Cantonese cuisine. If you walk by a Chinese BBQ restaurant, every single one will always have char siu hanging on its hooks by the window.
    </p>
    <h3>
        Ingredients
    </h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            2 lb pork shoulder (or a fatty cut, more on this later)
        </li>
        <li>
            1 tbsp garlic salt
        </li>
        <li>
            4 tbsp brown sugar
        </li>
        <li>
            2 tbsp oyster sauce
        </li>
        <li>
            2 tbsp light soy sauce
        </li>
        <li>
            1 tbsp hoisin sauce
        </li>
        <li>
            2 tbsp red wine
        </li>
        <li>
            1 tbsp Shaoxing wine
        </li>
        <li>
            1 cube red fermented bean curd
        </li>
        <li>
            1 tsp five spice powder
        </li>
    </ul>
    Basting Ingredients:
    <ul>
        <li>2 tbsp honey</li>
        <li>2 tsp water</li>
        <li>0.25 tsp red food coloring</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <strong>Prepare pork</strong>
        </li>
        <p>Cut the pork shoulder (2 lb) into long slices, roughly about 1 inch thick. We'll aim to cut each slice with uniform thickness so they cook at the same rate. </p>
        <p>Afterwards, we'll repeatedly poke each side of each slice with a fork to help the pork absorb our marinade more effectively.</p>

        <li>
            <strong>Prepare marinade</strong>
            <p>To a bowl, we'll add:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>garlic salt (1 tbsp)</li>
                <li>brown sugar (4 tbsp)</li>
                <li>light soy sauce (2 tbsp)</li>
                <li>hoisin sauce (1 tbsp)</li>
                <li>red wine (2 tbsp)</li>
                <li>Shaoxing wine (1 tbsp)</li>
                <li>red fermented bean curd (1 cube)</li>
                <li>five spice powder (1 tsp)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Mix the marinade until it's evenly distributed and smooth.</p>
            <p>If you'd like a more rich, red color, you can add a few drops of red food coloring (0.25 tsp).</p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <strong>Marinate pork</strong>
            <p>
                Place the meat into a zip-top bag, pour the sauce in, and massage the pork for about 2 minutes so that the sauce is able to finesse its way into the meat. Afterwards, we’ll push all the air out of the bag and seal it. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Place the bag in the refrigerator, and let the pork marinate overnight, or at least for around 6 to 8 hours.
            </p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <strong>Prepare char siu for oven</strong>
            <p>Preheat the oven to 425° F or 218° C.</p>
            <p>Set up the baking pan by lining the bottom with aluminum foil (so it's easier to clean!), and place the baking rack on top of the foil.</p>
            <p>Using tongs, start laying out the pork on the baking rack and pan.</p>
            <p>
                Add 1 to 2 tbsp of water to the bottom of the pan to help generate some steam as the char siu cooks, and to help prevent the drippings from burning and smoking.
            </p>
            <p>
                Carefully place it in the oven.
            </p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <strong>Roast and baste char siu</strong>
            <p>
                Now, we’ll be removing the char siu periodically to baste it again with either our leftover pork marinade, or honey (2 tbsp) diluted with water (2 tsp). 
            </p>
            <p>In total, this is about 50 minutes in the oven. </p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <strong>Final touches, let cool, cut and enjoy!</strong>
            <p>
                Once the char siu has finished its last cycle in the oven, we'll baste each side with our diluted honey.
            </p>
            <p>
                Let the char siu cool for about 5 minutes before cutting into it.
            </p>
        </li>
    </ol>
