    <p>
        Beef and broccoli is believed to originate from a Chinese dish called "Gai Lan Chao Niu Rou" (芥兰炒牛肉), also known as Chinese broccoli fried beef. Early Chinese immigrants could not find gai lan, a Chinese variant of broccoli, in the U.S. and so the broccoli that we know today became an easy substitute.

        <li>Beef and Broccoli Sauce Ingredients</li>

        <li>1 tbsp oyster sauce</li>
        <li>1 tsp light soy sauce</li>
        <li>1 tsp dark soy sauce</li>
        <li>1 tbsp water</li>
        <li>1 tbsp cooking wine</li>
        <li>1 tsp sugar</li>
        <li>1 tsp cornstarch</li>
        <li>0.25 tsp white pepper</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Cut and wash beef</strong></li>
        <p>Find the grains of the beef (12 oz) and cut against it. Do not cut the beef too thinly because thin meat will break easily during the cooking process.</p>

        <p>Place the meat in the bowl of water to wash the blood from the meat. To make this go faster, massage the meat in water. Once washing is completed, place the meat i</p>n a strainer to strain excess water and blood.
<p>        </p>
        <p>If you skip this step, the meat would turn black from the blood and not look appetizing.</p>

        <li><strong>Prepare beef marinade</strong></li>
        <p>Adding baking soda to meat is a common technique in Chinese cooking. It helps tenderize the beef. Depending on the weight of the meat, you will need to adjust the amount of baking soda. In this case, add baking soda (1 tsp), oyster sauce, light soy sauce, water (2 tbsp), cornstarch, white pepper, sugar, and cooking wine.</p>

        <p>Mix until incorporated.</p>

        <li><strong>Mix beef into marinade</strong></li>
        <p>Add the beef (12 oz) to the marinade and massage to have the meat fully covered with the marinade. Set aside and let it sit for 30 mins.</p>

        <li><strong>Cut broccoli and vegetables</strong></li>
        Now move onto the broccoli (1 lb) and cut it into bite-size pieces. Make sure to separate the large main stem for easier cooking.
        <p>Cut the carrot (0.50 ) into thin slivers for a more colorful presentation. Chinese restaurants tend to cut the carrots into little shapes to bring a more visual impact, but feel free to keep it simple here.</p>
        <p>Cut the ginger (1 small piece) into small cubes. A few slices will be sufficient.</p>
        <p>Cut scallions (1 stem) into small pieces on a diagonal.</p>
        <p>And mince the garlic (2 cloves).</p>

        <li><strong>Make sauce</strong></li>
        <p>In a small bowl, mix together the oyster sauce (1 tbsp), light soy sauce (1 tsp), dark soy sauce (1 tsp), water (1 tbsp), cooking wine (1 tbsp), sugar (1 tsp), cornstarch (1 tsp), and white pepper (0.25 tsp).</p>
        
        <li><strong>Boil broccoli</strong></li>
        <p>In a medium pot, bring the water to a boil and add a splash of oil and a generous pinch of salt (1 pinch). This helps to keep the broccoli green during cooking.</p>
        <p>Add the broccoli to the boiling water and cook it to your preference. Do not cook it for too long if you like a crunchier texture. If you like a softer texture, you can cook it for a longer period of time. For reference, we cooked it for about 2 minutes.</p>
        <p>Once cooked, drain the broccoli. If you aren't going to stir fry them immediately after, cool them with running water. Otherwise, you don't have to.</p>

        <li><strong>Cook beef</strong></li>
        <p>Add some cooking oil (1 tbsp) into the marinated beef and mix until all the meat is lightly coated in oil. This will seal in the juices of the meat.</p>
        <p>Heat up the wok to the highest heat, then add cooking oil (2 tbsp). Swirl the cooking oil around the wok to fully coat the bottom and sides. Pour out the excess oil.</p>
        <p>Slowly lower the heat and put in the meat. Cook the beef for around 30 to 60 seconds, or when it turns brown, which is your cue to flip.</p>
        <p>Flip the beef and cook it for 60 to 90 seconds or until it's mostly brown. It's fine if it's a little red, because we will continue to cook it with the vegetables.</p>
        <p>Once mostly cooked, turn off the heat and take the meat out from the wok. Set aside.</p>

        <li><strong>Stir fry vegetables and beef</strong></li>
        <p>Add the remaining oil and stir-fry the sides.</p>
        <p>Add the garlic (2 cloves) and ginger (1 small piece) first and fry for 20 to 30 seconds. Put in the scallions (1 stem) and carrot slices (0.50 ) and cook for another 20 to 30 seconds. Once cooked, add the broccoli (1 lb). Cook for another 30 to 40 seconds.</p>
        <p>Add back the beef. Cook everything together for 30 to 45 seconds.</p>
        <p>Because the broccoli absorbs a lot of liquid, you can add extra water to the sauce. We suggest 1 tbsp if needed.</p>

        <li><strong>Add sauce and stir fry everything</strong></li>
        <p>Add the sauce to the stir fry and constantly mix for about 1 minute. Add sesame oil (1 tsp). Once everything is incorporated, add a little more leftover oil to coat the broccoli — it will make it look very appetizing.</p>
        <p>This optional last bit of finishing oil is called 'mei jau' pronounced "may-yao." This is usually practiced in restaurants.</p>

        <li><strong>Taste test and plate</strong></li>
        <p>Taste to adjust the flavors and plate once it's to your taste! This is usually served at the center of the table and everyone can take the amount they want.</p>
